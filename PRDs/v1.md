### Product: Maybe Mobile

Goal: Deliver a cross-platform mobile app (iOS & Android via KMP) that makes Maybe’s personal finance engine accessible on the go.

Problem Statement:
Users want to track their finances, add expenses/incomes, set budgets, and get insights from anywhere. The current Maybe app is self-hosted web-only and lacks native mobile presence with push notifications.

Objectives:
*   Provide seamless mobile access to core Maybe features (accounts, transactions, budgets, AI assistant).
*   Support secure login, onboarding, and notifications.
*   Leverage Maybe’s backend API and rules engine; keep mobile lightweight.

Key Features (MVP v1):

1. Authentication (Sign up, Login, ~~2FA~~, ~~biometric~~).
    1. Google & Apple only for now
2. Onboarding
    1. Sliding
    2. List of items to expect with icons
3. Accounts (list, balances, trends, transfers).
4. Transactions (add/edit, categorize, auto-detect transfers, CSV import support optional).
5. Budgets & insights (monthly breakdown, overspend alerts).
6. AI chat assistant (natural language insights).
7. Notifications (credit due, monthly recap).
8. Settings (multi-currency, household invites).

Non-functional requirements:

*   KMP shared logic; SwiftUI + Jetpack Compose for UI layers. (iOS & Android)
*   Sync with Maybe backend via API keys.
*   Offline caching of recent data (transactions, budgets).
*   Secure storage for API tokens (Keychain / Keystore).

Dependencies:

*   Maybe backend API (Docker self-hosted).
*   Notification provider (e.g. Firebase Cloud Messaging + APNs).
*   Optional: bank connector integrations.
